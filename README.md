# all-purpose-calculator
A Math/Science calculator I created using PHP to help my classmates and I study

## Hello!
Just a little backstory for this project, I had just learned PHP and we had a one-week vacation from school. We had our finals for the quarter the week after the break, so I figured, why not make something that might help me study?

## Topics
1. Math
* Arithmetic and Geometric Sequence
* Finding the nth term of a sequence
* Finding the sum/series of a sequence
* Finding common difference/ratio

2. Science
* Wavespeed, wavelength, and frequency
* Magnets and electricity
* Lights

The website is hosted over here: https://allpurpcalc.000webhostapp.com/index.php

## How it works
This website uses pure PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. To run it, simply host the files on a webserver. xampp: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

I hope you enjoy:)
